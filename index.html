        <h1>Psychologist testimony in Congress 1946 - 2016</h1>
        <h3 id = "byline">by Liz Cory</h3>
        <p>
           The United States Congress frequently calls on experts to discuss policy and weigh in on proposed legislation. This project presents a brief history of US Congressional testimony given by psychologists.

                        the 1940s & '50s. Although it is difficult to pin down why exactly, it is often instructive to start by examining the past.

                        first met in 1953, and their years-long series of hearings investigated the potentially nefarious influence of comic books on young minds.
